Feature Engineering

Features				Transformation


Tracking_id			Separated Numeric part from the tracking id .

Datetime				Separated year, month and time from datetime where time contributes more as compared to other extracted 					feature.


Cloud level and turbine status		Both are categorical features , for NAN value a new category is assigned .

				Label Encoder is used to label the categories.




All numerical Features 		Check the -99 count in each feature, if the count has some prominent values  and there are more negative values 					then replace with the mean of feature.


				If there are less negative counts , assign -1 to all negative values.(treat -99 as outlier).



Model				XgBoost with hyperparameter optimization(Grid Search Cv).


Library & Encoders			Label Encoder , Pandas , Numpy , Seaborn ,Matplotlib ,Sklearn.
